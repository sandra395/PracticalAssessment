In this practice, I needed to create a website for a clinic. I needed to create three pages, for the desktop version.

The task consisted of designing the layout of the three pages using HTML and CSS. 

The teacher provided the details of the website (images, fonts, text, etc.) and a screenshot of the website. My task was to replicate it or make it as similar as possible.

I also had to check whether the colour combinations were accessible according to the WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. If they were not accessible, I needed to modify them to ensure they were.

Additionally, I had to validate the HTML and CSS.
